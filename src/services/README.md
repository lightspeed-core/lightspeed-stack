## Service Architecture

Services in this directory are designed to run alongside the main lightspeed-stack application, providing additional functionality for data collection, monitoring, and analytics.

Each service can be:
- Configured via the main `lightspeed-stack.yaml` configuration file
- Run independently using dedicated make targets
- Enabled/disabled based on deployment requirements

## Getting Started

To run a service, refer to its specific documentation for configuration options and startup commands. Most services can be started using make targets from the project root.
